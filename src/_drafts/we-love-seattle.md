      **The Best of Local Seattle&nbsp;**


      Getting to know any city requires research.&nbsp; When I travel I like to
      root out places where the locals hang out. I like to be immersed in the
      spirit of a city and to see it through the eyes of people who actually
      live there day to day. Sure, there are spots in every destination that
      have stood the test of time and are worth a visit, even if it means
      contending with clueless crowds armed with selfie sticks. In Seattle, at
      the top of the typical “must see” list includes the&nbsp;**Space Needle**,
      the&nbsp;**Waterfront**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Aquarium**,**&nbsp;Pioneer
      Square**,&nbsp;**Pike Place Market**&nbsp;and the
      original&nbsp;**Starbucks&nbsp;**cafe.&nbsp; All worthy stops to log into
      your “been there, done that” bucket list, but brace yourself for the
      teaming masses and long lines. As a longtime resident of Seattle and a
      connoisseur of culture and food, I think the best of our city lies outside
      the more expected tourist hot spots and resides in the unique
      neighborhoods that encircle the city.&nbsp;


      Here are my top picks, I promise none with disappoint. &nbsp;

      **Downtown.&nbsp;**


      2017 marks the second year in a row that the Seattle skyline boasts more
      construction cranes than any other city in the US. The city is in a major
      building boom and many areas of downtown are a traffic and navigation
      mess. Of the more expected downtown destinations, there are two I would
      recommend seeing for sure - the&nbsp;**Pike Place Market**&nbsp;near the
      waterfront and&nbsp;**Chihuly Garden and Glass**&nbsp;in Seattle Center.
      Pike Place Market is a year-round farmers market - used by Seattleites and
      tourist alike when sourcing local produce, seafood, cheese and dairy,
      baked goods and specialty items. For foodies like me, it’s a must see. Get
      there early to watch vendors set up, wander through the funky shops and
      then head upstairs to the exceptional&nbsp;**Mat’s in the Market&nbsp;**(a
      long-standing local favorite) for lunch and the best view of the
      market.&nbsp;**Chihuly Garden and Glass&nbsp;**opened in 2013 and since
      then it’s become the most loved thing to do in Seattle on Trip Advisor and
      many other travel sites. The largest permanent exhibition of local
      legendary glass artist Dale Chihuly exceeds expectations. The grounds
      include a stunning giant greenhouse and garden that organically
      incorporates his glass art. I was lucky enough to be on the team that
      developed this project (I created all branded materials) and proud to
      share it with visitors and locals alike.&nbsp;

      **Ballard.&nbsp;**


      About a 10-15 minute drive (depending on the ever increasing Seattle
      traffic) north from downtown takes you to the hip maritime neighborhood of
      Ballard, a powerhouse dining-shopping-drinking destination. Most people
      come out this way to see the famous**&nbsp;Ballard Locks&nbsp;**- the
      nation’s busiest lock system with over 40,000 vessels passing to and from
      the fresh water of Lake Washington to the Puget Sound. Fun to see and
      great for kids (especially the Fish Ladder that can exceed 100,000 salmon
      in migration) but for more lively experience, Downtown Ballard delivers.
      If you are lucky enough to be in the area on a Sunday, the&nbsp;**Ballard
      Farmer’s Market&nbsp;**is the best in Seattle and open year round. If
      organic carrots and handmade hemp soap are not your thing perhaps grabbing
      a beer is more your speed. Ballard has more breweries than any other
      neighborhood in Seattle or Portland. My personal favorite is&nbsp;**Stoup
      Brewing&nbsp;**with 20 beers on tap to sample, enjoy and take home.
      Looking for just the right cocktail amongst a hyper-local crowd?
      &nbsp;**Hazelwood**&nbsp;is a celebrated neighborhood gem and just happens
      to be owned by my brother - if you go, ask for Drew and tell him I sent
      you! There are way too many good restaurants to recommend - but for out of
      towners I would suggest heading to&nbsp;**Ray’s Boathouse,**&nbsp;an
      iconic Seattle waterfront establishment just outside Downtown Ballard with
      some of the best seafood and water views in the city. For a kickin’ Puget
      sound view complete with picnic and soft ice cream be sure to stop
      by&nbsp;**Golden Gardens**&nbsp;where locals frolic in tepid water, play
      volley ball and launch sailboats.

      **Capitol Hill.**


      Once the official hood of the LGBT community, Capitol Hill has gone though
      a major development spurt over the past 10 years and is at the heart of
      some of the best go-to spots in the city. The most beloved bookstore in
      Seattle -&nbsp;**Elliott Bay Books&nbsp;**relocated to the Capitol Hill
      neighborhood about 10 years ago into a beautiful new space that maintained
      the spirit of the old historic Pioneer Square location--must for book
      geeks. A few doors down from Elliott Bay Books is**Oddfellows Caf&eacute;
      & Bar,&nbsp;**a great spot for lunch and an always interesting crowd they
      offer breakfast, lunch and dinner and delicious baked goods to go. Around
      the corner from Oddfellows is the lovely and expertly curated urban
      apothecary,&nbsp;**Sugarpill.&nbsp;**Custom blended herbal remedies and
      hard to find epicurean treasures are thoughtfully displayed by the sage
      owner and my favorite holistic high priestess, Karyn Schwartz. Need a
      sugar fix? Ice cream seems to be the new cupcake in Seattle and Cap Hill
      has some fine choices, seriously consider checking out**Frankie and
      Jo’s&nbsp;**plant based (vegan) ice cream shop. I know, vegan ice cream
      does not sound a decadent as cream based, but try California Cabin or Date
      Shake and I bet your view of all things vegan will be forever changed.
      Last but not least, save room for a local classic
      --&nbsp;**Dick’s**&nbsp;burger (go for the “Deluxe”) and fries - a Seattle
      institution since 1954. For great views and local gardens be sure to
      visit&nbsp;**Volunteer Park&nbsp;**and&nbsp;**The Seattle Asian Art
      Museum.**

      **SoDo / Georgetown&nbsp;**


      Just south of the downtown Seattle is the cities’ industrial district and
      the location of our two fantastic ball parks,&nbsp;**Safeco
      Field&nbsp;**and&nbsp;**CenturyLink&nbsp;**Over the past 20 years or so,
      SoDo (South Of Downtown) has been transforming into a destination in its
      own right complete with luxury high rise apartments and condos. In
      addition to checking out a game (baseball, soccer, football) if the season
      is right, go vodka tasting at the fabulous&nbsp;**Glass Vodka Tasting
      Boutique&nbsp;**on First Avenue a few blocks south of Safeco Field.&nbsp;
      Glass Vodka is a premium, award-winning vodka distilled with Washington
      state grapes (instead of wheat or potatoes) and flavored with some of the
      best ingredients around - coffee, honey and Sri Lankan cinnamon. A client
      for the past 3 years, I’ve had the opportunity to share the entire Glass
      collection of vodkas with friends and it’s always a huge hit for those
      appreciating something truly unique and unexpected. Across the street is
      the&nbsp;**Filson**&nbsp;flagship store - a local heritage brand of
      quality outdoor gear since 1897.&nbsp; All items are guaranteed for life
      and the travel bags in particular are the darlings of fashion editors and
      heritage brand geeks alike. Drive a little further south and you will hit
      the artistic neighborhood of Georgetown. The once home of the Rainer
      Brewery from 1878 to 1999 (a beautiful brick building that now houses
      shops of all kinds) now is the “it” spot for the coolest antique shops and
      places to eat and drink. My favorite is the lively and
      colorful&nbsp;**Fonda La Cantina**&nbsp;- a family owned and seriously
      authentic Mexican restaurant and bar, complete with the best house
      margaritas and mole poblano in town.&nbsp;


      I’m happy to claim Seattle as my hometown. I love sharing it with others
      so if you have any questions or are in need of a recommendation beyond
      this article, feel free to drop me a line and ask! &nbsp;
