  By *Orit*

  30 years ago I walked away from corporate life as a group creative director to become an entrepreneur. Without looking back I rolled up my sleeves and got to work as an independent agency owner.&nbsp;
sections:
  - text_markdown: >-
      It was a simple agency model where design ruled but inevitably questions
      were constantly asked to get to deeper and more effective solutions. Even
      then, it wasn’t just about the design…our work had to have
      a purpose.&nbsp;

















      Time certainly flew by and my agency grew and grew. We became a robust and
      very passionate group of designers, strategists, producers and client
      services advocates. Our focus went from generalists to experts focused on
      luxury branding which proved a wise move especially in this ever-changing
      world. And work life continued to be good. No, not just good - great.

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>In 1993 The O Group hired our very first creative director Daymon Bruck
      and with his contributions the agency prospered and produced exceptional
      creative work. As a new entrepreneur, Daymon allowed me to “let go” of
      previous roles and realize my true strength was running a growing agency,
      building a unique culture, nourishing and guiding my staff, our partners
      and most importantly, the clients.

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**We cared, we worked hard and we had big dreams.&nbsp;**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Amazing clients like Salvatore Ferragamo, Miramax, Mo&euml;t Hennessy
      USA, Lacoste to Harry Winston and so many more fueled us forward through
      the years. While the world kept changing, we kept evolving. “Disrupting”
      the status quo was important in our hearts and souls, and most importantly
      for our clients.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**But then...something odd happened.**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Success doesn’t insure happiness, especially when your gut tells you
      something is out of place and not quite right. I knew something was not
      quite right. The traditional agency model was no longer serving me, and
      I had a feeling my clients sensed this too. As the agency grew, I started
      to become more and more removed from the work and day-to-day client
      interactions. I desperately needed to change it up because I was struggling
      to find the passion I once had for my work. I wanted to work better, work
      smarter and to forge true relationships with clients as I had so many times
      in the past 30 years.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**I needed to make a pretty major change.&nbsp;**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>I did not know what this new work model looked like, but one thing was
      for sure, I didn’t want to take on this new venture alone. 30 years without
      a partner was lonely and frustrating at times, so I reached out to someone
      that was a catalyst for change in my career many years ago, my first
      creative director - Daymon Bruck. After many years of East Coast based,
      large agency experience, he had moved back to Seattle to start his own
      branding agency. I shared with him my feelings about how the traditional
      agency model was “broken” and felt the need to evolve once again. He agreed
      and we began talking about the concept of a “deconstructed” agency. One
      where we are able to be adaptive and agile to the client’s changing needs.
      One where the value of working with seasoned experts who have a network of
      best in class experts/partners is exciting and adds value where it is need.
      One where the client isn’t paying for an entire staff of people even if
      they aren’t working on their project. Best of all, one where we pick and
      choose the projects and clients that WE have a true passion and desire for.
      The excitement, the romance, the passion came flowing back into both of our
      veins. And a new agency model was born.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**East joins West.&nbsp;**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Everything old has become new again. Except bigger, better and even
      more delicious and amazing. We are headquartered in NYC but launched
      O Group West in Seattle. As we celebrate our 30th anniversary this year,
      I feel life has come full circle. We are taking the best of the past and
      moving that success forward to rethink not only luxury but also how to best
      serve our clients. Our reforged partnership and the birth of O Group West
      is the right disruption in the tradition of embracing change. We are
      seasoned professionals that have the passion and experience to make this
      model a success and it’s the only way we care to do business. &nbsp;&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>So get ready friends. This is going to be an amazing time for our
      clients, our partners and us.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>-------daymon’s story!

      <br>Going back to my Future&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Most stories we know follow the expected format of a beginning, middle
      and an end, correct? Well...this one strays a bit from the expected.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>25 years ago I accepted my first job as a Creative Director in New York
      City. This beautiful pregnant woman named Orit (like Cher - no last name)
      said my portfolio “haunted” her, and asked if I would like to come work
      with her at her growing branding agency as the Creative Director. I was
      flattered, naturally - no one had ever mentioned a metaphysical connection
      to my work before and I said yes on the spot. My time at her branding
      agency, The O Group was one of the most rewarding of my career and after
      4 years together, it was time for me to move on to new challenges.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>In 1997, the digital medium was starting to gain traction in the agency
      world. I was keenly interested, so after The O Group I joined interactive
      team Ogilvy as a Creative Supervisor in the New York City office. The new
      medium was thrilling and as IBM as a key client, the creative work was
      challenging and juicy. After 11 years living in NYC it was time for me to
      move on and shortly after that decision was made I was recruited by Mullen
      just outside of Boston to join their team as VP, Interactive Creative
      Director. General Motors, Four Seasons Hotels, Coca Cola, The Oprah Network
      were just some of the mega brands I helped develop digital creative efforts
      for over the next few years. Career life was great - my personal life, not
      so much. I missed living closer to my family in Seattle and the West Coast
      in general, so in 2001 I packed up and moved back to Washington
      State.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Go West (Youngish) Man

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>After 5 more years at two great Seattle agencies (Cole & Webber and
      Hornall Anderson) leading creative efforts for clients like Nike,
      Starbucks, AT&T Wireless, Microsoft and the ACLU it was time for me to
      strike out on my own and in 2006 I started an independent branding
      practice. Over the next 10 years, my business and the size of my client
      base grew to include many respected brands such as the Space Needle, the
      Museum of History and Industry, Glass Vodka, DRY Soda, and Chihuly Garden
      and Glass - Seattle’s number one tourist destination since 2014. Having my
      own branding practice has been the greatest creative and business challenge
      of my career; I’ve loved every part of it except one - working alone can be
      pretty isolating. &nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>The Return of O

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Over the next 20 years Orit and I kept in touch on a regular basis, so
      I was not surprised to hear from her a month ago. Cutting to the point like
      a true New Yorker, she told me she was looking to change her current
      traditional agency model and wanted to work side-by-side with a creative
      partner on select clients only - and that partner she had in mind was the
      friendly ghost from her past - moi.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Without the need for tedious and in-depth soul searching - her
      invitation to get the band back together was met with a firm “Hell, Yes.”
      I didn’t need to second-guess myself because I believe when you find
      a relationship that really works on all levels, you’ve struck gold. I’ve
      always been amazed just how these special connections (business or
      personal) can last a lifetime, even with large gaps between seeing each
      other and can be brought back to life faster than a New York minute.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>My past has literally become my present and future. I became Partner
      and CCO at The O Group and lead the West Coast office in Seattle,
      appropriately labeled O Group West.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Who says you can’t go back? Having just one path ahead seems so
      shortsighted and single minded. From now on, I’m going to consider all
      directions up for grabs and open for business.&nbsp;
