      &nbsp;After their evaluation of hundreds of New York agencies, we are
      proud to announce our inclusion among the elite. Part of the methodology
      Clutch uses to determine its’ list is through verified client interviews.
      These interviews give an honest look at the work we’ve done and the
      experience our clients have had. Curious to see what our past partners
      have said about us? Check out this excerpt from our most recent
      review:&nbsp;


      *“I appreciate their personal service. The O Group has the ability to
      offer big brand agency work despite having a smaller size. The O Group has
      been spot-on, even with challenges such as ours… They are meticulous,
      organized, and easy to work with.&nbsp; We’ve set launch dates and they’ve
      stayed close to the schedule. Considering that we are a startup company,
      we’ve had to start and stop the work, and they’ve been flexible during
      these times. The O Group is very much a part of the team. Although we have
      a client relationship, it has evolved a lot.” Alexandria Leibowitz, Botage
