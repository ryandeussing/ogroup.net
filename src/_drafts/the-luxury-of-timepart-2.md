  **Part 2:&nbsp; The Luxury of Moving Ahead of Time**


  **Bypassing “Normal” Time &nbsp;**


  &nbsp;


  I remember taking a flight from NYC to Paris on the Air France Concord in the
  mid 90’s and when I got into the plane for the first time I thought – what so
  special about this? A tight and slightly claustrophobic cabin (by jumbo-jet
  standards) was just aquatically appointed and left me disappointed: I was
  expecting more after all the hype and prestige associated with the Concord
  brand. What did impress me (and my colleagues at the time) was the super fresh
  Parisian baked goods I brought back with me to the office at 9:00 am for
  breakfast, only 3.5 hours from taking off from France the same day. Those same
  pastries would have been day-old stale had they arrived by any other means
  available at the time. Reducing the hours spent in transit between
  destinations by any measure and making the most of your time on either side is
  still a luxury high on everyone’s list. &nbsp;


  &nbsp;


  Removing the barriers of time through speed, privilege or technology (VIP
  access, private jets, exclusive travel connections, etc.) and other types of
  rarefied access that allow for “jumping the line” provides the greatest luxury
  for those that put the highest value on their personal and professional time.
  Those five minutes you spend waiting in line (any line) will never be
  reclaimed. With less and less time and people putting more value on how they
  spend personal time, how will brands create experience worth our limited time?
  Bottom line - it better be amazing. As brand builders, we have been
  increasingly asking ourselves and our clients - what barriers, inconveniences
  or steps that create a personal time suck could be removed to provide a luxury
  experience that bypasses the normal or common flow of time?&nbsp;

      **Faster Than the Rest &nbsp;**


      Technology has obviously helped with the process of removing “normal”
      barriers of time. Starbucks with their Mobile Order & Pay allows you to
      place your order and pay ahead on the smart phone Starbucks app - walk
      into the store and without waiting in line, pick up your order and off you
      go. Many movie theaters are taking steps to minimize moviegoers’ time
      finding seats and parking spaces in order to maximize the movie going
      experience by offering reserved seating online ahead of time.&nbsp;


      &nbsp;


      The fashion industry has responded to the need for moving faster than
      normal and historic means by embracing the new “see-now-buy-now” approach
      that allows for customers to order items right off the runway. Brands like
      Tom Ford, Burberry, Diane von Furstenberg, and several others have
      launched these programs. In a recent press release Ford said “In a world
      that has become increasingly immediate, the current way of showing a
      collection four months before it is available to customers is an
      antiquated idea and one that no longer makes sense. Our customers today
      want a collection that is immediately available.” New technology, market
      trends, and changing social attitudes have brands catering to customer
      demands in an unprecedented manner. Today you can acquire nearly any item
      like a vintage Rolex watch from MrPorter.com the same day or order any
      service like a private jet charter with the swipe of a finger, and have
      practically anything you desire customized to your preferences. &nbsp;
